## Introduction

In this repository, we explore an extension of the Capital Asset Price Model (CAPM) that link the returns of an asset to multiple factors.

The motivation behind this is to explore how movement in multiple distinct and diverse markets affect the price of an asset. For example, if we consider a material mining company, the price of its stock may have a relatively low beta relative to the US Market or the Total Stock Market, but a high beta relative to the Commodities Market or Emerging Markets.

## Price Modelling

### Traditional CAPM

The typical CAPM model assumes the expected return of an asset is dependent on the risk free rate of return $$r_f$$, and the asset's sensitivity to systematic risk, i.e. its sensitivity $$\beta_i$$ to the market return $$r_m$$. The expected rate of return for asset $$i$$ is given by:

$$E[r_i] = E[r_f] + \beta_i(E[r_m]-E[r_f])$$

Intuitively, the return of asset $$i$$ cumulates the risk free return, with the market risk premium, the coefficient $$\beta$$ adjusts the market premium to how sensitive and volatile the asset is to market movement.

### CAPM With Alpha

A common extension to the CAPM is incorperating a coefficient, $$\alpha$$, called **Jensen's alpha**, to represent the realised returns of the asset that aren't explained by the market movement and the traditional CAPM model (the **edge** on the market).

We define Jensen's alpha by:

$$\alpha_i = r_i - r_f - \beta_i(r_m-r_f)$$

Note: Here we do not use expected returns but instead realised returns. Jensen's alpha essentially addresses CAPM limitation to predicting a asset's return.

We can also write the equation as:

$$r_i - r_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i(r_m-r_f)$$

### Multi Factor Capital Asset Pricing Modelling

Until now, we've been working under the assumption that there is a single "market return" and a single systematic risk. While this should be true is theory (by definition of the systematic risk), in reality assets can usually be clustered into different markets or sectors (e.g. technology, commodities, retail, etc.) each of which could have its own expected market return and systematic risk.

For example, a change in price of energy commodities, such as oil, may largely affect energy companies such as Exxon and Vistra, but may not have any effect on technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft.

Therefore, we use 8 benchmark markets:

- US Market: $ITOT
- Commodities: $DBC
- Emerging Markets: $EEM
- Total Bond Market: $BND
- World Technology: $IXN
- World Real Estate: $RWO
- World Agriculture: $DBA
- Energy: $DBE

We hypothesise that the asset's return is related to the risk free rate, each of the market returns, and the asset's unexplained returns.

We can generalise this formula to use $$n$$ benchmark markets, with returns $$r_{m,1}, r_{m,2}, ..., r_{m,n}$$, and asset's sensitivity to the markets $$\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n$$, yielding the model:

$$r =  r_f + \alpha + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n{\beta_i(r_{m,i}-r_f)}$$

## Experiment

We perform an analysis on the following stocks:

- NVIDIA: $NVDA
- Microsoft: $MSFT
- Berkshire Hathaway: $BRK.B
- Walmart: $WMT
- Eli Lilly: $LLY

<!-- - JPMorgan Chase: $JPM
- Exxon Mobil: $XOM
- Chevron: $CVX
- Coca-Cola: $KO
- Alibaba: $BABA -->

We collect the monthly Open-High-Low-Close data for the tickers through AlphaVantage. We then calculate the monthly percentage change of the Close prices, yielding the monthly returns for both the asset and the markets.

We also download the 3 Months US Treasury Bills from AlphaVantage, scale to obtain the monthly rate of return, and use that as the risk free rate.

We estimate the coefficient by using Ordinary Least Squares regression on the following equation, using the realised asset and market returns, and the real risk free rate:

$$r - r_f = \alpha + \sum\limits_{i=1}^n{\beta_i(r_{m,i}-r_f)} + \varepsilon$$

We also calculate the the simple CAPM, with Jensen's alpha, with OLS to solve the follow equation:

$$r - r_f = \alpha' + \beta'(r_u-r_f) + \varepsilon$$

We then compare the coefficients for the US market in both models, non-trivial coefficients for the 7 additional benchmark indices, and look for an improvement in the $$R^2$$ value of the models.

## Results

The $$R^2$$ for both the simple CAPM and the proposed MFAPM are summarised in the table below.

We notice systematic improvement when using our multi-factor model over the simple CAPM.

## Conclusion

Our multi-factor asset pricing model demonstrates a significant improvement over traditional CAPM across all tested securities. The results show that incorporating multiple market factors—including commodities, emerging markets, bonds, technology, real estate, agriculture, and energy, provides substantially better explanatory power for asset returns.

The improvement in $$R^2$$ values ranges from $$83.9\%$$ for Microsoft to an impressive $$293.4\%$$ for Walmart, with an average improvement of $$179.2\%$$. This suggests that the traditional single-factor CAPM may be leaving substantial explanatory power on the table by ignoring sector-specific systematic risk.

These findings have important implications for portfolio management and risk assessment. By understanding how assets respond to multiple market factors rather than just broad market movements, investors can better diversify their portfolios and hedge against specific risks. For instance, energy companies may show high sensitivity to commodity markets while being relatively insensitive to technology sector movements.

The enhanced model's superior performance validates our hypothesis that assets are influenced by multiple systematic risk factors. As financial markets become increasingly interconnected and complex, multi-factor models like MFAPM offer a more nuanced and accurate framework for understanding asset behavior and making informed investment decisions.
