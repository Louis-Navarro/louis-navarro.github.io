# What Is EveryStep?

EveryStep is a digital mental health intervention to support people on the waiting list for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Drawing on evidence-based techniques from CBT and cutting-edge behavioural science, our mobile app equips users with basic skills to help them begin the journey of improving their mental health.

In the UK 1.7 million people are referred for therapy each year. 1 million drop out before finishing.
EveryStep supports people on the NHS waiting list for CBT and helps people get the most out of CBT by equipping them with information, advice and more.

# My Role

As a full stack software developer, I had to develop a fully functional mobile application MVP to assist up to 1,700,000 CBT patients on the NHS waiting list. This included implemented a Figma design in Flutter, paying attention to details and coordinating with the engineering team and the designer to discuss modifications to the user interface and the application. We decided to use Firebase as a backend service for data and implement API calls to the service to provide the user with accurate data. Finally, I published the app on the App Store, helping anyone interested in CBT discover more it and prepare themselves for the sessions.
